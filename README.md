# Seek and Cross: Zebra Crosswalks and Signal Recognition for VIPs
The City College of New York: Senior Design Project Fall2016-Spring2017

## Project Description
For visually impaired persons (VIPs), navigating new and even familiar environments can be challenging. Crossing intersections is a particular challenge because it can be difficult to determine the state of traffic and whether or not they have the right-of-way. Our research will attempt to discover if a user can accurately determine the state of the pedestrian signal at a crosswalk. This will allow VIPs to know when theyâ€™re within the pedestrian phase of the crosswalk signal, and provide them with the information necessary to safely cross.
